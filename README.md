# EUCAP2020_Paper_My_Nanoantenna_Design_for_Dynamic_Control_of_Plasmonic_Metasurface_Emission
My Paper titled "An Asymmetric Star Design for the Dynamic Control of Quantum-Emitter-Coupled Plasmonic Nanoantenna Emission" which I worked on as a first author in the summer of my third year at zeail city. I've also included my poster presentation at EuCAP2020- the 14th Euro-Conference on Antennas & Propagation.

Here is a sneak peek at the Nanoantenna design on COMSOL:

And here is a look at the three main patterns of emission, as simulated on COMSOL, which are accessible and dynamically tuned through polarization tuning:
